# Architecture
MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) Architecture
This project is built using the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) architecture. MVVM-C is an extension of the MVVM pattern that introduces the Coordinator layer to manage navigation and screen flow in a more modular and scalable way.

Model: Contains the data structures and business logic.

View: The user interface layer, built using SwiftUI.

ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the View and Model, handling UI-related logic, state, and bindings.

Coordinator: Responsible for handling navigation logic and routing between views, helping to decouple navigation from view and view model logic.
